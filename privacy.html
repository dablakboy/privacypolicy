    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: <span id="current-date"></span></p>
    
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Reel Life ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.
    </p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 Photo and Video Library Access</h3>
    <p>
        The App requires access to your device's photo and video library to display your media in beautiful social media-style feeds. We access your photos and videos only with your explicit permission. Your media files remain on your device and are never uploaded to our servers, except as described in Section 2.1 (AI Caption Generation).
    </p>
    
    <h3>1.2 User-Generated Content</h3>
    <p>
        The App allows you to create and store the following information locally on your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> Username, bio, and profile avatar (stored locally only)</li>
        <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Your likes, notes, comments, favorites, and album organization</li>
        <li><strong>Generated Captions:</strong> AI-generated captions are cached locally on your device for offline access</li>
        <li><strong>App Settings:</strong> Your preferences for feed modes, widget configurations, and other app settings</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>1.3 Purchase Information</h3>
    <p>
        When you make an in-app purchase, Apple processes the transaction. We receive information about your purchase status to enable premium features. This information is stored locally on your device and may be synced with Apple's App Store or RevenueCat (if configured) for purchase restoration purposes.
    </p>
    
    <h3>1.4 Device Information</h3>
    <p>
        The App may collect basic device information (such as device type, operating system version) necessary for app functionality and compatibility. This information is used solely for technical purposes and is not linked to your identity.
    </p>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1 AI Caption Generation</h3>
    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> When you use the AI caption generation feature, the App sends image or video frame data to OpenAI's API to generate captions. This is the only time your media content leaves your device.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        When you request AI-generated captions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Image or video frame data is temporarily sent to OpenAI's servers for processing</li>
        <li>OpenAI analyzes the content and generates captions and hashtags</li>
        <li>The generated captions are returned to your device and cached locally</li>
        <li>OpenAI may retain the image data according to their privacy policy (please review OpenAI's privacy policy at <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://openai.com/privacy</a>)</li>
        <li>You can choose not to use the AI caption feature if you prefer not to share image data with OpenAI</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2.2 Local Data Storage</h3>
    <p>
        All other data, including your photos, videos, profile information, preferences, and generated captions, is stored locally on your device using secure local storage (MMKV and AsyncStorage). This data never leaves your device except as described in Section 2.1.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2.3 App Functionality</h3>
    <p>
        We use the information we collect to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display your photos and videos in the App</li>
        <li>Generate AI captions when requested</li>
        <li>Maintain your app preferences and settings</li>
        <li>Enable premium features based on your purchase status</li>
        <li>Provide customer support and improve the App</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    
    <h3>3.1 OpenAI</h3>
    <p>
        The App uses OpenAI's API for AI caption generation. When you use this feature, your image or video frame data is sent to OpenAI for processing. OpenAI's use of your data is governed by their privacy policy. We encourage you to review OpenAI's privacy policy at <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://openai.com/privacy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Data Sharing:</strong> Image/video frames are sent to OpenAI only when you explicitly request caption generation. OpenAI may use this data to improve their services. You can opt out of using the AI caption feature if you prefer not to share data with OpenAI.
    </p>
    
    <h3>3.2 Apple App Store</h3>
    <p>
        In-app purchases are processed through Apple's App Store. Apple collects payment information and processes transactions according to their privacy policy. We receive only purchase status information necessary to enable premium features.
    </p>
    
    <h3>3.3 RevenueCat (Optional)</h3>
    <p>
        The App may use RevenueCat for enhanced in-app purchase management and analytics. If RevenueCat is configured, purchase information may be processed through RevenueCat's services. RevenueCat's privacy policy applies to their processing of this data.
    </p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take data security seriously:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your photos and videos remain on your device and are never uploaded to our servers (except for AI caption generation as described above)</li>
        <li>All local data is stored using secure, encrypted storage mechanisms</li>
        <li>We do not collect, store, or transmit personal identifying information</li>
        <li>All data transmission to third-party services (OpenAI) uses secure HTTPS connections</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    
    <h3>5.1 Photo Library Access</h3>
    <p>
        You can control photo library access through your device settings:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can grant or revoke photo library access at any time in iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Photos</li>
        <li>You can choose "Limited Access" and select specific photos to share with the App</li>
        <li>Revoking access will prevent the App from displaying your photos, but will not delete any data stored locally in the App</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>5.2 AI Caption Generation</h3>
    <p>
        You have full control over AI caption generation:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>AI caption generation is optional - you can use the App without generating captions</li>
        <li>Captions are only generated when you explicitly request them</li>
        <li>You can delete cached captions at any time through the App settings</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>5.3 Local Data</h3>
    <p>
        You can manage your local data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete the App to remove all locally stored data</li>
        <li>Clear cache and preferences through the App settings</li>
        <li>Manage your profile, preferences, and app data within the App</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>5.4 Data Deletion</h3>
    <p>
        Since your data is stored locally on your device:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Deleting the App will remove all locally stored data</li>
        <li>You can clear specific data (captions, preferences) through App settings</li>
        <li>For data sent to OpenAI, please refer to OpenAI's privacy policy for deletion requests</li>
    </ul>
